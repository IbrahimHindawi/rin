# I TODO

## Recently Landed: Recoverable Diagnostics And The Missing C Surface

- [x] Diagnostics are collected instead of fatal. `diag_record_error()` replaced the
      `exit(1)` at every source-level error site, so one bad line no longer hides the
      rest of the file. Reporting stops at 25 errors.
- [x] Parser error recovery: statements resync to the next `;`/`}` and declarations
      resync to the next column-1 declaration, so a single parse error stops
      inventing follow-on errors in code that is fine.
- [x] Every `{ ... }` body loop terminates at end of file, so an unclosed brace
      reports once instead of spinning.
- [x] JSON diagnostics are a single well-formed array across any number of
      diagnostics, closed on every exit path via `atexit`.
- [x] `//` and `/* */` are the comment forms. `#` is C preprocessor passthrough, and a
      `#` line that is not a recognized directive is a lexer error instead of silently
      becoming a directive in the generated C.
- [x] Char literals with escapes (`'a'`, `'\n'`, `'\x41'`, octal), with diagnostics for
      empty, unterminated, multi-character, and unknown-escape forms.
- [x] `~`, and `shl=` / `shr=` compound assignment.
- [x] Enum values accept constant expressions, including negative values and sibling
      references (`B = A` emits `Color_A`, which was previously emitted unmangled).
- [x] `static` internal linkage for procs, globals, and locals. Static symbols are
      kept out of the generated header.
- [x] `goto` with `name: label;` declarations, validated proc-wide so a goto can jump
      forward, with duplicate-label and undeclared-label diagnostics.
- [x] Struct bitfields (`flags: u32 : 4;`). Reflection reports zero offset/size/align
      for them rather than emitting invalid `offsetof`.
- [x] Anonymous struct/union members. Field access, duplicate detection, and
      reflection all flatten them the way C does.
- [x] `#line` is emitted only where the implied position would drift, cutting
      generated C by about a quarter. `--emit-all-line-directives` restores full
      output, and a test asserts both map every line to the same source position.
- [x] New `tests/rin-torture/execute` differential suite links and runs each fixture and
      compares stdout, so codegen that compiles but computes the wrong answer fails.
- [x] Error-recovery regression tests cover multi-error reporting, parse resync, and
      unclosed braces in both terminal and JSON modes.

- [x] `volatile` type qualifier, for memory-mapped registers and signal-visible
      state. Carried through generics and mangled distinctly, so `Array<volatile T>`
      and `Array<T>` stay separate monomorphs.
- [x] Fixed a long-standing monomorph bug: a generic instantiated on anything other
      than a plain name emitted the mangled spelling as a C type name, so
      `Array<*i32>` generated `ptr_i32 * data;` and did not compile. The same held
      for `Array<const i32>` and `Array<*const char>`. Mangles are now recorded
      against the type they came from, and emission recovers the real type.
- [x] Passthrough `#if`/`#endif` balance is validated, so an unterminated conditional
      or a stray `#endif`/`#else`/`#elif` is an I diagnostic pointing at the `.i`
      line instead of a C error pointing at generated code.
- [x] `tests/run_i_fuzz.py` mutates the corpus and asserts the front end always
      degrades into diagnostics, never a crash, hang, or malformed JSON. It found
      four real defects when first written: an infinite loop on a non-literal
      `printfmt` format, two segfaults, and an out-of-bounds argument read.
- [x] `tests/run_i_debuginfo.py` reads the DWARF line table and confirms generated
      code maps back to `.i` source and that reduced `#line` output produces a table
      identical to full output. Verified non-vacuous: stripping `#line` makes rows
      point at the generated `.c`.
- [N] Expression-level poison type. Already satisfied: an unresolved
      `infer_expr_type` result is the poison value, so independent errors in one
      statement all report while unresolved sub-expressions stay quiet. Locked in by
      the `recovery_within_statement` test.
- [N] LSP single-diagnostic assumptions. `compiler_diag_items_to_lsp_diags` already
      iterates the array, so multi-error publishing needed no change.

## Uniform Declarations And Blocks

One rule, no exceptions: every declaration is `name : kind = value`, and every body
is a block.

- [x] Variables must be initialized. `= {}` zeroes; `= ?` leaves storage untouched
      and lowers to a plain C declaration, so a large buffer costs exactly what the
      equivalent C costs. Struct fields and proc parameters are exempt: they have
      nothing to initialize.
- [x] Switch cases and defaults take a block and emit a real C block. This fixed a
      live miscompile: same-named locals in two cases used to land in the switch's
      single shared scope and emit a C redefinition error, which the compiler
      accepted and clang rejected.
- [x] Labels take a block: `done: label = { ... }` emits `done: { ... }`. Note the
      block is scoping only. Control still falls out of it into the following code,
      so stacked labels chain the way C labels always have.
- [x] Neovim support moved under `nvim/` with `install.py` (copy, `--link`,
      `--dest`, `--dry-run`, `--uninstall`).
- [x] Filetype detection rewritten in Lua using `vim.filetype.add()`. Neovim's
      built-in table claims `*.rin` for Progress, and a plain autocmd races it;
      verified stock Neovim reports `filetype=progress` and the installed config
      reports `filetype=i`.
- [x] Syntax file corrected: `//` and `/* */` had no rules at all and fell through
      to the identifier match, and `#` was styled as a comment. Comments, strings
      and directives are now defined last so they win at the same start column, and
      a `#` line that is not a recognized directive is highlighted as an error,
      matching the compiler.
- [x] Verified in real Neovim: filetype, syntax groups, LSP attachment, and three
      simultaneous red squiggles from one buffer.

## Real-Project Validation (Gini)

- [x] Gini compiles with the current toolchain: 14,896 lines across 15 files,
      full import graph, parse + semantic + type check clean, and codegen to
      20,585 lines of C. Needed 42 blockless switch arms migrated for the new
      block rule; nothing else in 14k lines had to change.
- [x] Compiling Gini immediately found a compiler bug the fixture suite missed:
      a stray statement between switch arms was re-reported until the diagnostic
      cap stopped it, because that loop reported without advancing. Fixed, with a
      regression test.
- [x] Scopes now chain to their parent instead of deep-copying it. Copying meant
      every proc and nested block duplicated the whole outer scope: ~1.9M element
      copies on Gini, because the outermost scope holds a reflection global per
      struct.
- [x] Proc lookup by name is hashed instead of a linear scan: ~5M string
      comparisons on Gini, quadratic in program size.

### Resolved: `check` on a real project was ~6x slower than it needed to be

`collect_generic_proc_instances_with_sites(prog, decl, ...)` computed a whole-program
instantiation closure — seeding from every global and every non-generic proc body,
then iterating a fixpoint over generic bodies — and did it **once per generic proc**.
But `decl` only selects which results are returned in the last ten lines; everything
before it is identical no matter which decl is asked about. A project pulling in the
std containers has 135 generic procs, so that closure ran 135 times per pass, in
three passes.

It is now computed once and shared, invalidated when the proc list grows (imports)
or when the printfmt pass rewrites bodies, which can introduce new generic calls.

| | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| debug build | ~910 ms | ~155 ms |
| optimized build | ~690 ms | ~135 ms |

Verified semantics-preserving: generated `.c` and `.h` for a 14,896-line project are
byte-identical before and after, 274 checks pass, 3000 fuzz inputs clean, and the
project still builds and links.

Found by profiling, after four rounds of measurement had ruled out the wrong things.
The lesson worth keeping: the per-statement counters looked flat because they only
counted the outer walk; these collectors do their own separate full-program walks.

### Historical: the measurements that ruled out other suspects

This matters because it is the LSP's hot path. Measured, so nobody repeats it:

| pass | time |
| --- | --- |
| expand imports (21 imports, lex + parse) | 33 ms |
| semantic check | ~339 ms |
| type check | ~383 ms |
| printfmt rewrite | ~319 ms |

Ruled out by measurement, not by reasoning:

- the mangle registry added for the monomorph fix (identical timing with it disabled)
- scope copy volume (1.9M copies removed, ~5% total gain)
- proc name lookup (5M comparisons removed, folded into the same ~5%)
- allocation volume: only 159k `type_new`, 113k `clone_type_expr`, 113k
  `infer_expr_type` calls for the whole program

The cost is spread almost evenly across three whole-program passes, and
`semantic check` costs as much as the others while using none of the type-checking
machinery.

Two measurements narrow it a long way:

1. **The printfmt pass does no printfmt work.** With the project's only two
   `printfmt` calls commented out, so the program contains zero, the pass still
   costs 264ms versus 261ms with them. It is paying the traversal, nothing else.
2. **Nothing is being re-walked.** Statement visits per pass: `semantic` 10,003,
   `type` 10,109, `printfmt` 10,003. One visit per statement, as intended.

So the cost is roughly **27 microseconds per statement node**, in three passes that
share nothing but the walk. That is ~100k cycles per statement, so it is one
expensive thing happening per node, not an algorithmic blowup.

Next step is a sampling profiler. The question to answer is narrow: *what costs
27µs on a single statement node?* Ruled out above: re-traversal, printfmt work,
mangle registry, scope copying, proc lookup, allocation volume.

The two fixes above are still worth keeping: both replace superlinear work with
linear, which matters more as projects grow, and generated C is byte-identical
after both.

Follow-ups worth doing next:

- [ ] `#define`s in opposing `#if`/`#else` branches collide as duplicate globals,
      because conditionals are collected without being evaluated. Pre-existing, and
      only reachable when both branches define the same name.
- [ ] Volatile is transparent to type compatibility: it is mangled and emitted, but
      not enforced, so dropping `volatile` through a pointer is left to the C
      compiler to reject. Match the existing `const` pointer rules if that becomes
      a real problem.
- [ ] Consider replacing the linear mangle registry scan with a hash if compile time
      on large projects starts to show it; it is not measurable today.

## Current Target: Clangd-Style Ergonomics

The language is now viable enough to compile and run Gini. The next phase should focus on making I sharp to write, diagnose, and edit, not on expanding the language surface or making generated C pretty.

Generated C only needs to be valid, stable enough, and debuggable when necessary. Pretty emitted C can wait.

## Progress

- [x] Compiler JSON semantic diagnostics are covered for `sizeof`/`alignof` arity and undeclared type/generic-type failures.
- [x] Compiler JSON diagnostics include primary source ranges, and the LSP publishes compiler-provided ranges instead of guessing one-character squiggles.
- [x] Compiler JSON type diagnostics include mismatch notes for pointer/value suggestions, fixed-array pointer decay element mismatches, generic instantiation sites, and proc signature mismatches.
- [x] Compiler JSON proc/proc-pointer arg-count diagnostics include expected-params notes, matching the human terminal diagnostics.
- [x] Human parser and named semantic diagnostics underline known token/name ranges with caret-plus-tilde spans.
- [x] The LSP publishes compiler JSON diagnostics through `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` while keeping the existing fast Python diagnostics.
- [x] The LSP treats compiler JSON diagnostics as the source of truth when `rin.exe --check` is available, using Python diagnostics only as a fallback.
- [x] Compiler-backed LSP diagnostics publish with source `I`, while fallback Python diagnostics remain source `i-lsp`.
- [x] The LSP feeds dirty buffer text to `rin.exe --check` through compiler stdin mode, preserving the real source path for imports and diagnostic ranges.
- [x] The LSP `didChange` hot path publishes compiler diagnostics only for the edited buffer and skips import reloads, workspace diagnostics, and compiler symbol extraction.
- [x] The LSP debounces `didChange` compiler diagnostics on a background timer, so typing does not synchronously wait for `rin.exe --check`.
- [x] Debounced LSP diagnostics discard stale compiler results when a newer dirty buffer has replaced the scheduled text.
- [x] The LSP `didOpen` attach path skips compiler symbol extraction, workspace-wide diagnostic publishing, and Python semantic diagnostics, cutting Gini attach from ~11.5s to ~0.14s in the local synthetic open test.
- [x] The LSP `didChange` path handles a synthetic Gini edit in ~2.4ms locally, sending no diagnostics inline and queueing one debounced compiler check.
- [x] LSP semantic requests now refresh compiler-backed workspace symbols from one `rin.exe --symbols=json` import-graph call instead of per-import symbol subprocesses.
- [x] LSP compiler symbol ingestion caches JSON file path/URI resolution, cutting Gini one-shot symbol ingestion from ~0.88s to ~0.10s locally.
- [x] First Gini `workspace/symbol` is ~98ms locally after one-shot compiler ingestion; repeated requests are ~2ms from cache.
- [x] The LSP debounces compiler workspace-symbol prefetch after open/edit, so dirty-buffer completions can use warmed compiler symbols without synchronously spawning `rin.exe --symbols=json`.
- [x] Bulk completion items are lean and defer rich docs to `completionItem/resolve`, keeping Gini completion after symbol prefetch around ~7.7ms locally.
- [x] Completion local-scope matching caches the current proc scope/range once per request instead of rescanning the proc for every local candidate.
- [x] `rin.exe --lsp=json` emits checked LSP payloads with diagnostics plus import-graph symbols, and emits the existing JSON diagnostic list on checked failure.
- [x] LSP scheduled diagnostics use the faster `rin.exe --check --diagnostics=json` path, while workspace symbols are refreshed by a separate idle prefetch or on-demand semantic request.
- [x] Gini dirty-buffer diagnostics are measured separately from symbol JSON extraction, keeping live red-squiggle publication on the ~85ms compiler-check path instead of waiting for the 1.2 MB symbol payload.
- [x] Semantic-token generation uses cached proc ranges/scopes and one-pass identifier resolution, cutting Gini semantic tokens from ~1.4s to ~14ms locally.
- [x] LSP semantic requests no longer reapply the same compiler workspace symbol graph on every request, and reference/rename/highlight paths use a warmed workspace identifier index.
- [x] Gini reference requests are sub-millisecond locally after background warmup (`gin_update` ~0.3ms, `gops_update` ~0.5ms).
- [x] Workspace-symbol prefetch defaults to a longer idle debounce, applies compiler workspace symbols, and warms the reference index without blocking the live diagnostic path.
- [x] The LSP reference index stores precise generic spans without duplicate simple-identifier locations, keeping `Array` and `Payload` references inside `Array<Payload>` distinct.
- [x] The LSP reference-index builder skips expensive sanitizing/normalization on ordinary lines and simple identifiers, cutting Gini index construction from ~120ms to ~35-42ms and idle symbol prefetch from ~206ms to ~146ms locally.
- [x] Dirty `didChange` now uses a text-only hot path that preserves the warmed symbol graph immediately, defers compiler symbol refresh to the idle timer, and cuts large Gini file edit handling from ~12-32ms to ~0.2-0.4ms locally.
- [x] Compiler diagnostics and symbol extraction support dirty imported modules through `--stdin-path`, so the LSP can check the real project entry while overriding the edited buffer text.
- [x] Gini imported-module diagnostics now run through `src/gin_win32.rin`, so edits in files like `gops.i` publish live red diagnostics for the edited file instead of being checked as fake standalone entries.
- [x] LSP `didOpen` now uses a path-only buffer scan and leaves workspace semantics to compiler symbol prefetch, cutting large Gini file attach from ~30ms to ~1-2ms locally.
- [x] Compiler workspace-symbol application loads imported documents with the same path-only scan before applying compiler metadata, cutting Gini idle symbol warmup from ~318ms to ~209ms locally.
- [x] Cold `textDocument/semanticTokens/full` no longer forces synchronous compiler symbol warmup while idle prefetch is pending; it returns lexical current-buffer tokens instead, cutting Gini `gops.i` cold semantic tokens from ~275ms to ~16ms locally.
- [x] Semantic token results are cached by document text and workspace index revision, making repeated cold/warm Gini token requests sub-millisecond locally.
- [x] Default `textDocument/semanticTokens/full` now stays on the fast lexical path even after workspace symbols are warm; rich compiler-backed semantic tokens are opt-in through `I_LSP_RICH_SEMANTIC_TOKENS=1`.
- [x] With the fast semantic-token default, measured Gini `gops.i` locally at cold semantic tokens ~18ms, warm semantic tokens ~2ms, document symbols ~2ms, completion ~12ms, references ~3ms, and live dirty diagnostics ~109ms.
- [x] Cold `documentSymbol`, `completion`, and `documentHighlight` no longer synchronously force compiler symbol warmup while the idle prefetch is pending.
- [x] Scheduled LSP diagnostics now preserve the file URI from compiler JSON and publish imported-file errors to the imported file, instead of filtering every compiler diagnostic back to the opened project entry.
- [x] Scheduled LSP diagnostics remember which file URIs were published for each project-entry check and send empty diagnostics to stale imported-file URIs after a clean compiler run.
- [x] Optional `I_LSP_TRACE` logging records live diagnostic publish counts and compiler diagnostic latency without writing to LSP stdout.
- [x] The Neovim installer copies `ftdetect/i.vim`, `syntax/i.vim`, `ftplugin/i.lua`, and `after/ftplugin/i.lua`, so `*.rin` buffers get both syntax and an attached `i-lsp` client.
- [x] The Neovim I ftplugin only marks a buffer attached after `vim.lsp.start()` succeeds, runs the server from the project root, and enables underline/sign diagnostics with insert-mode updates.
- [x] The LSP compiler-diagnostic cache keys on the `rin.exe` binary timestamp, so it recovers when the compiler is built or rebuilt.
- [x] Compiler-backed LSP workspaces parse/index imports without retaining Python fallback diagnostics; standalone `Workspace()` still keeps fallback diagnostics for tests and compiler-missing use.
- [x] `rin.exe --symbols=json` emits compiler-backed top-level symbols from live stdin source, and LSP `documentSymbol` prefers that data when available.
- [x] `rin.exe --symbols=json` emits compiler-backed struct/union fields, including owner, detail, attributes, and source ranges.
- [x] `rin.exe --symbols=json` emits compiler-backed proc parameters and local declarations, including nested block and for-init locals.
- [x] `rin.exe --symbols=json` emits structured proc metadata (`params`, `return_type`, `variadic`) for LSP signature help and completions.
- [x] `rin.exe --symbols=json` emits structured type metadata for fields, globals, parameters, locals, and aliases.
- [x] `rin.exe --symbols=json` emits structured enum-member owner/item metadata.
- [x] `rin.exe --symbols=json` emits proc scope metadata for parameters and local variables.
- [x] `rin.exe --symbols=json` emits structured proc metadata for direct proc/proc-pointer aliases.
- [x] `rin.exe --symbols=json` emits generic type-param metadata for structs and fields.
- [x] The LSP workspace index uses compiler-backed top-level symbols and globals when available, while preserving Python imports and path completions.
- [x] The LSP field index uses compiler-backed struct/union fields when available, while preserving Python field parsing as fallback.
- [x] The LSP variable index uses compiler-backed globals, proc parameters, and locals when available, while preserving Python variable parsing as fallback.
- [x] LSP completion, definition, and hover paths are covered against compiler-backed top-level symbols/globals, not only Python-parsed symbols.
- [x] The LSP advertises and serves `workspace/symbol` from the compiler-backed workspace index.
- [x] The LSP advertises and serves `textDocument/documentHighlight` using the same resolved symbol, field, enum member, local, and global reference paths.
- [x] The LSP has proc argument completions using signature-help context, including `name.&` suggestions for pointer parameters.
- [x] LSP signature help and proc-argument completions are covered against compiler-backed proc symbols/variables, not only Python-parsed signatures.
- [x] LSP proc signature help prefers compiler-backed structured proc params/return metadata over parsing human detail strings.
- [x] LSP proc hover prefers compiler-backed structured proc params/return metadata over display strings.
- [x] LSP proc completion detail prefers compiler-backed structured proc params/return metadata over display strings.
- [x] LSP symbol ingestion prefers compiler-backed `type`/`target_type` metadata over parsing display strings for fields, variables, and aliases.
- [x] LSP enum member resolution prefers compiler-backed owner/item metadata over parsing generated names or display strings.
- [x] LSP enum document-symbol children and enum hover member lists prefer compiler-backed owner/item metadata over generated-name prefixes.
- [x] LSP enum usage lookup, references, rename, and semantic tokens prefer compiler-backed owner/item metadata over emitted symbol names.
- [x] LSP local/parameter matching prefers compiler-backed proc scope metadata when available.
- [x] LSP proc-pointer alias signature help prefers compiler-backed alias params/return metadata over parsing target strings.
- [x] LSP generic field substitution prefers compiler-backed owner type-param metadata instead of assuming `T`.
- [x] LSP generic proc signature substitution prefers compiler-backed proc type-param metadata over parsing display names.
- [x] LSP alias hover prefers compiler-backed target/proc metadata over parsing display strings.
- [x] LSP callable argument diagnostics and call-expression type inference prefer compiler-backed proc metadata over parsing display strings.
- [x] LSP semantic token classification is covered against compiler-backed symbols/variables, not only Python-parsed symbols.
- [x] The LSP has expected-type completions for typed assignments, including matching locals/globals and pointer address-sugar suggestions.
- [x] The LSP has context-aware enum member completions and struct literal field completions.
- [x] Added an `rin-torture/compile` smoke corpus that transpiles I fixtures to C and compiles them, covering control flow, pointer/array/proc-pointer code, unions, alias-backed callbacks, nested generics, and reflection.
- [x] Expanded the local `gcc.c-torture/compile` smoke corpus and fixed nested generic struct dependency emission exposed by the translated-I corpus.
- [ ] Broaden compiler JSON output to every remaining ad hoc semantic/type/codegen diagnostic.
- [ ] Move more LSP semantic ownership from Python helpers to compiler-backed checks.

## Remaining LSP Work

The current LSP is good enough to use. Future work should keep Python as transport/cache glue and avoid adding new compiler-like semantics there.

- [ ] Add a cheap `i-lsp doctor` or `--self-check` path that reports which `rin.exe` is used, whether it exists, filetype install paths, debounce settings, and whether compiler diagnostics are enabled.
- [ ] Package the LSP with the I toolchain instead of vendoring it per project: ship `scripts/rin_lsp.py` / `rin_lsp.bat` under `RIN_HOME`, have Neovim launch that centralized server through `RIN_HOME` or PATH, and remove the need for `njinn` / playground-local `scripts/rin_lsp.py` copies.
- [ ] Add a headless Neovim smoke test for `*.rin` filetype detection, `i-lsp` attachment, and a real `publishDiagnostics` red-squiggle flow.
- [ ] Move hover/definition/completion edge cases that still depend on Python inference into compiler `--lsp=json` metadata, especially generic instantiated fields, proc-pointer calls, enum members, aliases, and expected-type contexts.
- [ ] Add compiler-provided completion contexts for proc args, struct literals, enum values, field access, and typed assignment so Python mostly formats completion items instead of deciding semantic matches.
- [ ] Add compiler-provided reference/rename spans for project files, including generic names like `Array<T>reserve`, enum generated values, fields, globals, locals, and imported modules.
- [ ] Add cancellable compiler-check workers or generation-aware subprocess cancellation if large projects make stale `rin.exe --check` runs pile up during typing.
- [ ] Keep semantic tokens lexical by default; only expand rich semantic tokens if the compiler can emit token data cheaply enough to stay invisible during editing.
- [ ] Add optional trace timing summaries for `didOpen`, `didChange`, diagnostics, completion, symbols, semantic tokens, references, and rename, with Gini as the default perf fixture.
- [ ] Later, consider replacing repeated subprocess calls with a long-lived native analysis process or compiler library mode while keeping the same JSON/LSP contract.

## Debugger And Visual Studio Notes

The current Visual Studio debugger path is good enough:

- [x] Gini debug builds compile generated I C with CodeView/PDB flags (`/Zi /Od /Ob0 /RTC1`) and link with `/debug`.
- [x] I emits `#line` mappings, so Visual Studio can step through `.i` source while debugging the generated C/PDB.
- [x] Mapping the `.i` extension to the C/C++ editor in Visual Studio is acceptable syntax highlighting for now because I is intentionally C-shaped.
- [x] Disassembly side-by-side with `.i` stepping works well enough for the current debugging workflow.
- [ ] If Visual Studio highlighting becomes annoying, add a small VSIX/TextMate grammar for I instead of a full Visual Studio language service.
- [ ] Add focused Natvis only where the default debugger view is not enough. Useful candidates are `string8`, arenas, generated arrays/vectors, math types, handles, and reflection metadata.
- [ ] Keep generated C/PDB names stable and I-like where practical, but do not spend time making generated C pretty unless it directly improves debugging.

## Generated C Hygiene And Type Operations

The current type-operation model works and should stay simple:

- [x] Delayed generic body checking allows generic algorithms to call `add<T>`, `eq<T>`, `print<T>`, and similar operations, then type-check those calls at concrete instantiation time.
- [x] Concrete proc specializations like `add: proc<i32>` and `add: proc<payload>` lower to stable C names like `add_i32` and `add_payload`.
- [x] Keep type operations concept-free for now. If `add<T>`, `eq<T>`, `hash<T>`, or `print<T>` is missing, report the missing proc directly.
- [N] Add standard primitive type-operation families: `add<T>`, `sub<T>`, `mul<T>`, `div<T>`, `eq<T>`, `less<T>`, `hash<T>`, `print<T>`, and later `clone<T>` / `destroy<T>` if runtime ownership needs them.
- [x] Add regression tests for generic algorithms that call type operations, missing type-operation diagnostics, and transitive type-operation dependency closure.
- [ ] Teach the LSP to understand type-operation calls and concrete specializations for hover, goto definition, completion, and diagnostics.
- [N] Revisit concepts only if missing-operation diagnostics become too noisy. Concepts should group and document required type operations, not become a second dispatch system.
- [x] Fix direct formatted printing of generic call results: `printfmt("{}\n", add<i32>(1, 1));` should infer the placeholder argument type from the resolved `add<i32>` return type without requiring a temporary local.
- [x] Fix expected-type propagation for designated literals in call arguments: `add<payload>({.x = 2}, {.x = 2})` should infer each literal as `payload` from the concrete proc parameter type and lower to valid C compound literals.
- [x] Add the full playground type-operation sample as a regression test: std imports, `payload`, `add<i32>`, `add<payload>`, `sum<T>`, direct `printfmt(add<i32>(...))`, direct designated-literal call args, `Array<payload>reserve`, and accumulation.

Generated C from the playground proves the model works, but the output needs cleanup:

- [x] Move the large reflection runtime helper block out of every generated `.c` / `.h` and into a stable runtime header such as `std/reflect.h` or `core.h`.
- [x] Make that reflection runtime header own its required C includes (`stddef.h`, `string.h`, etc.) instead of spraying helper dependencies into generated files.
- [x] Avoid emitting reflection helper code when the generated unit only needs reflection metadata, or keep it as a single include.
- [ ] Decide whether every imported std/internal struct should be reflected by default. The current output reflects `memops_arena`, `memops_arena_temp`, and monomorphs like `Array_payload`; that is useful, but it can add noise.
- [ ] Keep the generated ordering stable and readable: includes, macros, forward declarations, struct definitions, reflection metadata, prototypes, normal definitions, monomorph definitions.
- [ ] Reduce `#line` spam. Keep enough `#line` directives for source debugging and useful compiler errors, but avoid emitting one before nearly every field and statement if it is not needed.
- [ ] Keep generated C valid and debuggable before making it pretty. Pretty generated C is lower priority than stable source mapping and correct compilation.
- [ ] Decide whether generated C should keep using `structdecl` / `structdef` macros or expand to plain C typedef/struct declarations.
- [ ] Add a clear diagnostic or documented rule for `#` in I source. If `#` means C preprocessor passthrough, then `# todo...` is not a comment and should fail clearly or be replaced by a real comment form.
- [x] Add generated-C snapshot tests for reflection metadata, monomorph ordering, type-operation calls, and `#line` placement.

## 1. Compiler Diagnostics First

Make every compiler error more clang-like:

- exact file, line, column, and range
- underline the bad token or expression
- show expected vs actual type/token
- show declaration-site notes
- show import-chain notes
- show generic instantiation notes
- show generated C line-map notes when relevant

The internal move should be a real diagnostic system instead of ad hoc `printf` plus `exit`.

Target shape:

```text
error: proc 'foo' argument 2 expected '*Payload', got 'Payload'
  --> src/game.i:42:19
   |
42 |     foo(arena, payload);
   |                ^^^^^^^
   |
note: parameter declared here
  --> src/foo.i:3:24
note: imported through: main.rin -> game.i -> foo.i
```

## 2. Compiler Check Mode And JSON Diagnostics

Add:

```text
rin.exe --check file.i
rin.exe --check file.i --diagnostics=json
```

`--check` should parse, import, validate, and type-check without requiring generated C as the primary output.

`--diagnostics=json` should emit structured diagnostics suitable for the LSP:

```json
{
  "severity": "error",
  "file": "src/sops.rin",
  "line": 439,
  "column": 65,
  "message": "proc argument 3 expected '*cgltf_float', got 'vec2'",
  "notes": []
}
```

## 3. LSP Diagnostics From The Compiler

The Python LSP should stop pretending to be the real compiler for errors.

Fast path:

- LSP runs `rin.exe --check file.i --diagnostics=json` on save/debounce
- LSP publishes compiler diagnostics directly to nvim
- red squiggles come from the real compiler
- compiler diagnostics become the source of truth

This gives clangd-style feedback without rewriting the LSP immediately.

## 4. Keep Python LSP As A Thin Shell

Python is fine as a temporary LSP frontend. It is slow if it owns all semantics, but acceptable if it mostly handles:

- JSON-RPC
- file watching / debounce
- path completion
- calling `rin.exe --check`
- publishing compiler diagnostics
- caching simple symbol indexes

Long-term, the LSP should be native or backed by compiler/library analysis. Short-term, do not rewrite it. Make it useful.

## 5. Ergonomic LSP Features

High-value editor features:

- proc argument completion
- expected-type completion
- enum member completion
- struct literal field completion
- better hover showing resolved type
- goto definition through imports
- rename/references good enough for project files
- live diagnostics from compiler JSON

Proc arg completion should reuse signature-help machinery.

## 6. Keep Modules Stupid

No `pub`, no `private`, no fancy visibility for now.

Current rule:

- imports are visible
- duplicate symbols are errors
- import order is deterministic
- generated output is one merged unit unless there is a practical reason not to
- diagnostics explain where duplicate/imported symbols came from

This is basically C-style global soup, but with better errors.

## 7. Generated C Only Needs To Compile

Do not spend energy making generated C beautiful right now.

Keep only:

- valid C
- stable enough names
- useful `#line`
- no broken include/header ordering
- debuggable enough for hard runtime crashes

If something serious crashes, debug generated C/assembly normally.

## 8. Tests For Ergonomics

Add tests that lock in diagnostics and LSP behavior:

- parser diagnostic snapshots
- type diagnostic snapshots
- import-chain diagnostic snapshots
- generic instantiation diagnostic snapshots
- LSP `publishDiagnostics` tests
- completion tests for proc args
- completion tests for enum members
- completion tests for struct fields and struct literals
- larger `gcc.c-torture/compile` corpus
- later: translated C torture cases into I

## Immediate Next Work

Do this in order:

1. Add compiler `--check`.
2. Add compiler `--diagnostics=json`.
3. Convert the LSP to publish compiler diagnostics.
4. Add proc argument completion.
5. Add enum/struct-field completions.
6. Improve compiler diagnostic formatting.
7. Expand c-torture and start translating small torture cases to I.
