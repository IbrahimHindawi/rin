/* Every name here carries an `i_` prefix because this header's contents land in
   the C global namespace of every I program -- reflection tables are emitted
   unconditionally. `reflect` unprefixed is a plausible identifier for
   third-party C to claim: it is a GLSL builtin, and any vector-math library an
   engine links is fair game.

   The prefix is `i_`, not `__i_`: C reserves every identifier beginning with two
   underscores, or an underscore followed by an uppercase letter, to the
   implementation for any use. Buying namespace hygiene with undefined behaviour
   would contradict the one correctness claim this backend makes.

   I source keeps the short spelling -- `reflect`, `reflect_fields` -- and the
   compiler maps those onto the names below when it emits C. See
   reflect_runtime_c_name() in src/main.c, and std/reflect.rin for the rin side. */

/* One record describes every reflected type. `kind` says which, and `variant`
   holds the payload that only that kind has. This replaces the older split
   between the old separate type and enum records, which forced every consumer to
   know in advance which of two unrelated records it was going to be handed.

   The layout here must match std/reflect.rin exactly. Both `kind` fields are
   spelled i32 rather than as C enums on purpose: C leaves an enum's underlying
   type implementation-defined, so a C enum here would make the struct's layout
   depend on the compiler while the rin side mirrors it as a fixed i32. */

   and the rest -- are now written in I, in std/reflect.rin. They were pure logic
   over the data below, so a C header was the wrong home: there they could not be
   type-checked, could not be read in the language that uses them, and had to be
   mirrored by a hand-written set of `external` declarations that nothing kept in
   step.

   What stays here is what C has to own: the record layouts, because the compiler
   emits its reflection tables as C initialisers of these types. */
